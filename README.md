## Introduction

Hand detection is a crucial task in computer vision, and the Single Shot Multibox Detector (SSD) MobileNet model offers an efficient and accurate solution. The SSD architecture is a real-time object detection method that combines the strengths of both object localization and object detection into a single network. MobileNet is a lightweight deep learning model that provides fast inference times, making it suitable for real-time applications on resource-constrained devices.

This project aims to demonstrate how to train the SSD MobileNet model on a custom hand detection dataset and deploy the trained model for practical use.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow 2.x
- NumPy
- OpenCV

Ensure you have these libraries installed before proceeding with the installation.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/hand-detection-ssd-mobilenet.git
cd hand-detection-ssd-mobilenet
```

2. Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install the required packages:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Dataset

Gather or create a dataset of images labeled with hand annotations. The dataset should be in PASCAL VOC or COCO format. Organize the dataset into `train` and `test` sets for training and evaluation purposes. Ensure you have a proper balance of positive and negative samples to achieve good training results.

## Training

1. Prepare the dataset: Place the training and testing datasets in the appropriate directories, following the required format.

2. Configure the training settings: Adjust the hyperparameters, batch size, learning rate, and other parameters in the `config.py` file.

3. Start training: Run the training script using the following command:

```
python train.py
```

4. Monitor training progress: During training, you can visualize the loss and other metrics using TensorBoard.

## Inference

Once the model is trained, you can use it to detect hands in new images or video streams. Use the following command to perform inference on a single image:

```
python inference.py --image path/to/your/image.jpg
```

To perform inference on a video stream, use:

```
python inference.py --video path/to/your/video.mp4
```

## Evaluation

Evaluate the trained model on the test dataset to measure its performance. Use the following command to assess the model's accuracy:

```
python evaluate.py
```

## Results

Include a brief summary of the model's performance and any visualizations of the detection results. Provide insights into potential areas for improvement or ways to optimize the model.
